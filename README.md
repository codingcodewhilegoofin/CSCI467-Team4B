# GS
Github is a website itself [Github](https://github.com/codingcodewhilegoofin)

Git is a source control system that tracks your code and has a backup for it all on your system, then sent to github.com

Here's actual git to download : [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

Markdown is what you use to write in your .README files so it doesn't look like garbage, also what I used to write this

# FS

Full-Stack refers to how many different coding programs you need to make a different program. The reason it's a stack is because there is layers to it. There is the front-end, back-end, database, and other layers in between.

Great Full Stack site : [CodingPlayground](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/codingground.htm)

MERN is just our specific "stack" that we chose. Its a simple 4 layer stack with easy programs to learn and efficient for an ecommerce store

Front-end: Is just what the User/Customer interacts with. It also talks to the back end. We will use ReactJS for this. React also has other things to download along with it from NPM

Back-end: This is where you basically translate lots of code and shtuff coming from the front end to be able to talk to your databse. We can use NodeJS for this. It kinda sorta converts it to SQL. However Mongo doesn't use typicall SQL I believe. If Mongo sucks we can use SpringBoot and Gradle

DB: The data base just holds our info. Thats pretty much it, but needs to follow DB rules

ExpressJS: Is a framework to make working with NodeJS easier

NPM: Is the node package manager and is very usefull unless you want to write your own messy code for years and never turn in this project lol.

We might need this too , not sure yet [Pivitol](https://run.pivotal.io/)
